        <h1>Hi! I'm Jer.</h1>
        <p>I'm an engineer, product designer, and entrepreneur.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently the Head of Hardware for <a href="https://rzero.com">R-Zero Systems</a> where I was the first engineer and built the hardware team and manufacturing capabilities from scratch. In our first two years, we launched the Arc, Beam, and Vive. R-Zero was named a World Changing Idea by <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90742802/world-changing-ideas-awards-2022-wellness-finalists-and-honorable-mentions">Fast Company</a> and made <a href="https://rzero.com/blog/r-zero-named-to-forbes-2022-next-billion-dollar-startups-list/">Forbes</a> list of the next billion-dollar startups. R-Zero has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/r-zero">$170M</a> in venture capital funding. Please see below for some of the awards won by products I designed with the team I built. </p> 
        
        <p>I am also the founder of <a href="https://www.blossomcoffee.com">Blossom Coffee Inc.</a> Blossom is an engineering consultancy and intellectual property development company with the mission to make good coffee more accessible. At Blossom, we launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/1/3432980/blossom-one-limited-coffee-maker-11111">Blossom One Brewer</a> and served coffee to <a href="https://youtu.be/-L_Z9pZx4Ko">2Chainz</a> on GQ's Most Expensivest series. We developed and launched the Dripper and filters for <a href="https://sprudge.com/building-better-dripper-blue-bottle-coffee-113097.html">Blue Bottle Coffee</a>. We lead R&D for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Auto-iQ-Frother-Baskets-Thermal-CP307/dp/B07FX73Y7H?th=1">Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System</a>.</p>
        
        <p>In 2018 I transitioned to managing Blossom on the side and I joined <a href="https://fellowproducts.com">Fellow Products</a> full-time as a product designer. At Fellow, I lead the development of the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/ode-brew-grinder">Ode Brew Grinder</a>, the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/shimmy-coffee-sieve">Shimmy Coffee Sieve</a>, and the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/products/prismo">Prismo</a>. I also helped recruit and grow their product development team.</p>
        
        <p>I am honored to have served as a <a href="https://uscoffeechampionships.org/2022-competitors/2022/3/11/jeremy-kuempel">judge</a> for the USA Coffee Brewer's Cup Championship in 2020, 2022 and 2023.</p>
        
        <p>I write a lot and occasionally publish things. You can check out some of my articles on <a href="https://brokeassstuart.com/2022/07/11/now-that-everybody-left-i-love-sf-more-than-ever/">Brokeass Stuart</a>.</p>
