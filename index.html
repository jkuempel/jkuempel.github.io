        <h1>Hi! I'm Jeremy.</h1>
        <p>I'm an engineer, product designer, and entrepreneur.</p>
        
        <p>I am available for consulting work where I can help you with product development, manufacturing, or all things coffee. I am also passionate about Artificial Intelligence and am looking to meet founders and engineers in that space.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently the Head of Hardware for R-Zero Systems where I was the first engineer and built the hardware team and manufacturing capabilities from scratch. In our first two years, we launched the Arc, Beam, and Vive. We reduced SARS-Cov-2 by 53% in a joint study with Harvard and the Mayo Clinic. Our products won two Red Dot Design awards and an IDEAs award. R-Zero has raised $170M+ in venture capital financing.</p>
        
        <p>I am also the founder of Blossom Coffee Inc. Blossom is an engineering consultancy and intellectual property development company with the mission to make good coffee more accessible. At Blossom, we launched the Blossom One Brewer and served coffee to 2Chainz on GQ's Most Expensivest series. We developed and launched the Dripper and Filters for Blue Bottle Coffee. We lead R&D for the Ninja Hot and Cold brewer.</p>
        
        <p>I previously worked for Fellow Products as the Director of Product. At Fellow, I led the development of the Ode Brew Grinder, the Shimmy coffee sieve, and the Prismo. I also helped recruit and grow their world-class product development team.</p>
        
        <p>I am honored to have served as a judge for the USA Brewer's Cup Championship three times.</p>
        
        <p>I write a lot and occasionally publish things. Check out some of my articles on <a href="https://www.brokeassstuart.com/">Brokeass Stuart</a>.</p>
